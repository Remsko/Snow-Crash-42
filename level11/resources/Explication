#In our home directory we have a .lua file which execute a listener on 127.0.0.1:5757

#If we watch the code, we can quickly understand how it work, it will ask us a password, hash it and compare it 

#But here is the trap (i felt in it), once you saw this you may want to find the reverse hash of the pass 
#But if you look closer to the if else condition, they do absolutely nothing

#Here is the real breach :

prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")

#This function concatenate our "password" input with the sha1sum shell command 

#Let's abuse this breach by using some pipes in the pass

netcat 127.0.0.1 5151
